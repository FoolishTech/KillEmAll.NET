# KillEmAll.NET
C# implementation of KillEmAll Mini  
  
KillEmAll.NET IMMEDIATELY terminates unnecessary programs (those non-essential to Windows) and reports the result in a console window.  WARNING:  Any data not saved will be lost!  
  
KillEmAll.NET.exe does not run as Administrator by default, so it will fail to terminate any programs running as Administrator unless you run KillEmAll.NET.exe as Administrator.  Some protected Windows processes will fail to terminate regardless; this behavior is normal.  
  
Requires .NET Framework 4.0
