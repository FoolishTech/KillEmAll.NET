# KillEmAll.NET
C# implementation of KillEmAll Mini  
  
KillEmAll.NET is a ‘panic‘ button with an ‘ask questions later‘ attitude, designed to terminate unnecessary programs (those non-essential to Windows) and report the results in a console window.  WARNING:  Any data not saved will be lost!  
  
KillEmAll.NET.exe does not run as Administrator by default, so it will fail to terminate any programs running as Administrator unless you run KillEmAll.NET.exe as Administrator.  Some protected Windows processes will fail to terminate regardless; this behavior is normal.  
  
Requires .NET Framework 4.0
